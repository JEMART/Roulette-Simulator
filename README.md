# Roulette-Simulator
Simulates the net profit from a number of roulette systems

Following roulette systems are included:

  The Martingale System
  
  The Paroli System
  
  The Dalembert System
  
  The Fibonacci System
  
  The 1-3-2-6 System
  
You can search on google for more details on each system. However, for each system you have a minimal bet that you put in after a cycle is completed. A cycle is a betting process where you place bets after a betting system until you win. In Martingale for example, you double each bet until you win and then you have a net profit equal to your minimal bet. All systems rely on only betting on red or black which gives you the money back plus your bet. 

For each simulation set the minimal bet, the number of rolls with the roulette and which color to start with (red or black).

# Warning
As the simulator shows you, the betting system does not work in reality. You will always loose against the bank. I strongly recommend not to use any roulette system with real money.
